        <p>
            The Gym Equipment Tracker app is designed to revolutionise the gym experience by integrating modern technology for enhanced 
            convenience and efficiency. By utilising NFC (Near Field Communication) tags—discreet stickers attached to each piece of gym 
            equipment—the app allows users to interact with gym machines in a more intelligent and intuitive way. 
            <br /><br />
            With a simple scan using their smartphones, users can effortlessly log their workouts, access detailed exercise instructions, 
            and receive real-time updates on equipment maintenance status. This innovation not only streamlines the user experience but also 
            promotes safety and informed decision-making, making it an essential tool for both fitness enthusiasts and gym administrators.</p>

            Working on this problem helped to widen our understanding of NFC Mobile applications, how it functions and how useful it will be for users to navigate their GYM Tracker app. All these helped us to find the best features that solved the key problems of our users. Although it was very challenging for us but we found ways to break into solutions that makes GYM Tracker unique.<br /><br />
            There are still some challenges we hope to find solutions to and make them into features that our users will find useful. This, we plan to do with more user testing of the app to ensure it suites into our users needs
